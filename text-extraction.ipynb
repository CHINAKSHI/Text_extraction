Numerousefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoderarchitectures [38, 24, 15].Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and outputsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hiddenh h tstates , as a function of the previous hidden state and the input for position . This inherentlyt t−1sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longersequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achievedsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditionalcomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamentalconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance inthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanismsare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and insteadrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art intranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.2 BackgroundThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic buildingblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions growsin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makesit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this isreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution dueto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention asdescribed in section 3.2.Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positionsof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has beenused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering andlanguage modeling tasks [34].To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relyingentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivateself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].3 Model ArchitectureMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].(x , ..., x )Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations to a sequence1 nz = (z , ..., z ) zof continuous representations . Given , the decoder then generates an output1 n(y , ..., y )sequence of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive1 m[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.2Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fullyconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,respectively.3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks N = 6Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of identical layers. Each layer has twosub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each ofthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer isLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)) Sublayer(x), where is the function implemented by the sub-layeritself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embeddingd = 512layers, produce outputs of dimension .model N = 6Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of identical layers. In addition to the twosub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-headattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connectionsaround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attentionsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. Thismasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that thei ipredictions for position can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than .3.2 AttentionAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum3Scaled Dot-Product Attention Multi-Head AttentionFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of severalattention layers running in parallel.of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of thequery with the corresponding key.3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product AttentionWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists ofd dqueries and keys of dimension , and values of dimension . We compute the dot products of the√k vdquery with all keys, divide each by , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on thekvalues.In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed togetherQ K Vinto a matrix . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices and . We computethe matrix of outputs as: TQK√Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( )V (1)dkThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor1of . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with√dka single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention ismuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimizedmatrix multiplication code.dWhile for small values of the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperformsk ddot product attention without scaling for larger values of [3]. We suspect that for large values ofkd , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it hask 14extremely small gradients . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by .√dk3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention dInstead of performing a single attention function with -dimensional keys, values and queries,model hwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values times with different, learnedd d dlinear projections to , and dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions ofk k v dqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding -dimensionalv4 q kTo illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of and are independent random(cid:80)d0 1 q · k = 0 dq kvariables with mean and variance . Then their dot product, , has mean and variance .k i i ki=14output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, asdepicted in Figure 2.Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representationsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.OMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head , ..., head )W1 hQ K V, KW , V W )head = Attention(QWwhere i i iiQ R R Rd ×d K d ×d V d ×d∈W W ∈ W ∈Where the projections are parameter matrices , , vk kmodel model modeli iiRO hd ×dW ∈and .v model h = 8In this work we employ parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we used = d = d /h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational costk v modelis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our ModelThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows everyposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics thetypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as[38, 2, 9].• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, valuesand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in theencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of theencoder.• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend toall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftwardinformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this−∞inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to ) all values in the inputof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward NetworksIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fullyconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. Thisconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.FFN(x) = max(0, xW + b )W + b (2)1 1 2 2While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parametersfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.d = 512The dimensionality of input and output is , and the inner-layer has dimensionalitymodeld = 2048.ff3.4 Embeddings and SoftmaxSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the inputdtokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension . We also use the usual learned linear transfor-modelmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. Inour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax√dlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by .model5Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operationsn d kfor different layer types. is the sequence length, is the representation dimension, is the kernelrsize of convolutions and the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.Layer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path LengthOperations2O(n · d) O(1) O(1)Self-Attention 2O(n · d ) O(n) O(n)Recurrent 2O(k · n · d ) O(1) O(log (n))Convolutional kO(r · n · d) O(1) O(n/r)Self-Attention (restricted)3.5 Positional EncodingSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of theorder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of thetokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at thedbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension modelas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,learned and fixed [9].In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:2i/dP E = sin(pos/10000 )model(pos,2i) 2i/dP E = cos(pos/10000 )model(pos,2i+1)pos iwhere is the position and is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding2π 10000 · 2πcorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from to . Wechose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend byk P Erelative positions, since for any fixed offset , can be represented as a linear function ofpos+kP E .posWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the twoversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal versionbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encounteredduring training.4 Why Self-AttentionIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representationsRd(x , ..., x ) (z , ..., z ) x , z ∈to another sequence of equal length , with , such as a hidden1 n 1 n i ilayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention weconsider three desiderata.One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that canbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-rangedependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting theability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have totraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the inputand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also comparethe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of thedifferent layer types.As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentiallyO(n)executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires sequential operations. In terms ofcomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence6n dlength is smaller than the representation dimensionality , which is most often the case withsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involvingrvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size inthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximumO(n/r)path length to . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.k < nA single convolutional layer with kernel width does not connect all pairs of input and outputO(n/k)positions. Doing so requires a stack of convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,O(log (n))or in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest pathskbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive thankrecurrent layers, by a factor of . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity2O(k · n · d + n · d ) k = nconsiderably, to . Even with , however, the complexity of a separableconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,the approach we take in our model.As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributionsfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attentionheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntacticand semantic structure of the sentences.5 TrainingThis section describes the training regime for our models.5.1 Training Data and BatchingWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 millionsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piecevocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each trainingbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000target tokens.5.2 Hardware and ScheduleWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models usingthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. Wetrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on thebottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps(3.5 days).5.3 Optimizer −9β = 0.9 β = 0.98 ϵ = 10We used the Adam optimizer [20] with , and . We varied the learning1 2rate over the course of training, according to the formula:−0.5 −0.5 −1.5lrate = d · min(step num , step num · warmup steps )_ _ _ (3)model warmup stepsThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first _ training steps,and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We usedwarmup steps = 4000_ .5.4 RegularizationWe employ three types of regularization during training:7Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on theEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.BLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)Model EN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FRByteNet [18] 23.75 201.0 · 10Deep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 19 202.3 · 10 1.4 · 10GNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 18 209.6 · 10 1.5 · 10ConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 19 202.0 · 10 1.2 · 10MoE [32] 26.03 40.56 208.0 · 10Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 20 211.8 · 10 1.1 · 10GNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 19 217.7 · 10 1.2 · 1041.29ConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 183.3 · 10Transformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 192.3 · 1028.4 41.8Transformer (big)Residual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to thesub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and thepositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate ofP = 0.1.drop ϵ = 0.1Label Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value [36]. Thislshurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.6 Results6.1 Machine TranslationOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)2.0in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than28.4BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of . The configuration of this model is3.5 8listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took days on P100 GPUs. Even our base modelsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any ofthe competitive models. 41.0On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of ,1/4outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than the training cost of theprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French usedP = 0.1 0.3dropout rate , instead of .dropFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, whichwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We4 α = 0.6used beam search with a beam size of and length penalty [38]. These hyperparameterswere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during50inference to input length + , but terminate early when possible [38].Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other modelarchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train amodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained5single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU .6.2 Model VariationsTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base modelin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.8Table 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but nocheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-headattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.dIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size hurts model quality. Thisksuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibilityfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace oursinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identicalresults to the base model.6.3 English Constituency ParsingTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on Englishconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structuralconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequencemodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].d = 1024We trained a 4-layer transformer with on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of themodelPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokensfor the semi-supervised setting.We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parametersremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we9Table 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23of WSJ) Parser Training WSJ 23 F1Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of andfor both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.Our results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-prisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of theRecurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-Parser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.7 ConclusionIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely onattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures withmulti-headed self-attention.For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures basedon recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our bestmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. Weplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text andto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputssuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/.tensorflow/tensor2tensorAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitfulcomments, corrections and inspiration.References arXiv preprint[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Numerousefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoderdecoderarchitectures 38, 24, 15.Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and outputsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hiddenh h tstates , as a function of the previous hidden state and the input for position . This inherentlyt t1sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longersequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achievedsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks 21 and conditionalcomputation 32, while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamentalconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance inthe input or output sequences 2, 19. In all but a few cases 27, however, such attention mechanismsare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and insteadrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art intranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.2 BackgroundThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU16, ByteNet 18 and ConvS2S 9, all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic buildingblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions growsin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makesit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions 12. In the Transformer this isreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution dueto averaging attentionweighted positions, an effect we counteract with MultiHead Attention asdescribed in section 3.2.Selfattention, sometimes called intraattention is an attention mechanism relating different positionsof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Selfattention has beenused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,textual entailment and learning taskindependent sentence representations 4, 27, 28, 22.Endtoend memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simplelanguage question answering andlanguage modeling tasks 34.To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relyingentirely on selfattention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivateselfattention and discuss its advantages over models such as 17, 18 and 9.3 Model ArchitectureMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoderdecoder structure 5, 2, 35.x , ..., x Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations to a sequence1 nz  z , ..., z  zof continuous representations . Given , the decoder then generates an output1 ny , ..., y sequence of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is autoregressive1 m10, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.2Figure 1: The Transformer  model architecture.The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked selfattention and pointwise, fullyconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,respectively.3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks N  6Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of identical layers. Each layer has twosublayers. The first is a multihead selfattention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feedforward network. We employ a residual connection 11 around each ofthe two sublayers, followed by layer normalization 1. That is, the output of each sublayer isLayerNormx  Sublayerx Sublayerx, where is the function implemented by the sublayeritself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sublayers in the model, as well as the embeddingd  512layers, produce outputs of dimension .model N  6Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of identical layers. In addition to the twosublayers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sublayer, which performs multiheadattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connectionsaround each of the sublayers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the selfattentionsublayer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. Thismasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that thei ipredictions for position can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than .3.2 AttentionAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of keyvalue pairs to an output,where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum3Scaled DotProduct Attention MultiHead AttentionFigure 2: left Scaled DotProduct Attention. right MultiHead Attention consists of severalattention layers running in parallel.of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of thequery with the corresponding key.3.2.1 Scaled DotProduct AttentionWe call our particular attention Scaled DotProduct Attention Figure 2. The input consists ofd dqueries and keys of dimension , and values of dimension . We compute the dot products of thek vdquery with all keys, divide each by , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on thekvalues.In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed togetherQ K Vinto a matrix . The keys and values are also packed together into matrices and . We computethe matrix of outputs as: TQKAttentionQ, K, V   softmax V 1dkThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention 2, and dotproduct multiplicative attention. Dotproduct attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor1of . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feedforward network withdka single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dotproduct attention ismuch faster and more spaceefficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimizedmatrix multiplication code.dWhile for small values of the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperformsk ddot product attention without scaling for larger values of 3. We suspect that for large values ofkd , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it hask 14extremely small gradients . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by .dk3.2.2 MultiHead Attention dInstead of performing a single attention function with dimensional keys, values and queries,model hwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values times with different, learnedd d dlinear projections to , and dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions ofk k v dqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dimensionalv4 q kTo illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of and are independent randomcid:80d0 1 q  k  0 dq kvariables with mean and variance . Then their dot product, , has mean and variance .k i i ki14output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, asdepicted in Figure 2.Multihead attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representationsubspaces at different positions.

For each of these we used  d  d h  64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational costk v modelis similar to that of singlehead attention with full dimensionality.3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our ModelThe Transformer uses multihead attention in three different ways: In encoderdecoder attention layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows everyposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics thetypical encoderdecoder attention mechanisms in sequencetosequence models such as38, 2, 9. The encoder contains selfattention layers. In a selfattention layer all of the keys, valuesand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in theencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of theencoder. Similarly, selfattention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend toall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftwardinformation flow in the decoder to preserve the autoregressive property. We implement thisinside of scaled dotproduct attention by masking out setting to  all values in the inputof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.3.3 Positionwise FeedForward NetworksIn addition to attention sublayers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fullyconnected feedforward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. Thisconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.FFNx  max0, xW  b W  b 21 1 2 2While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parametersfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.d  512The dimensionality of input and output is , and the innerlayer has dimensionalitymodeld  2048.ff3.4 Embeddings and SoftmaxSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the inputdtokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension . We also use the usual learned linear transformodelmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted nexttoken probabilities. Inour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the presoftmaxdlinear transformation, similar to 30. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by .model5Table 1: Maximum path lengths, perlayer complexity and minimum number of sequential operationsn d kfor different layer types. is the sequence length, is the representation dimension, is the kernelrsize of convolutions and the size of the neighborhood in restricted selfattention.Layer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path LengthOperations2On  d O1 O1SelfAttention 2On  d  On OnRecurrent 2Ok  n  d  O1 Olog nConvolutional kOr  n  d O1 OnrSelfAttention restricted3.5 Positional EncodingSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of theorder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of thetokens in the sequence. To this end, we add positional encodings to the input embeddings at thedbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension modelas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,learned and fixed 9.In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:2idP E  sinpos10000 modelpos,2i 2idP E  cospos10000 modelpos,2i1pos iwhere is the position and is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding2 10000  2corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from to . Wechose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend byk P Erelative positions, since for any fixed offset , can be represented as a linear function ofposkP E .posWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings 9 instead, and found that the twoversions produced nearly identical results see Table 3 row E. We chose the sinusoidal versionbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encounteredduring training.4 Why SelfAttentionIn this section we compare various aspects of selfattention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variablelength sequence of symbol representationsRdx , ..., x  z , ..., z  x , z to another sequence of equal length , with , such as a hidden1 n 1 n i ilayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of selfattention weconsider three desiderata.One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that canbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.The third is the path length between longrange dependencies in the network. Learning longrangedependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting theability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have totraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the inputand output sequences, the easier it is to learn longrange dependencies 12. Hence we also comparethe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of thedifferent layer types.As noted in Table 1, a selfattention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentiallyOnexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires sequential operations. In terms ofcomputational complexity, selfattention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence6n dlength is smaller than the representation dimensionality , which is most often the case withsentence representations used by stateoftheart models in machine translations, such as wordpiece38 and bytepair 31 representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involvingrvery long sequences, selfattention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size inthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximumOnrpath length to . We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.k  nA single convolutional layer with kernel width does not connect all pairs of input and outputOnkpositions. Doing so requires a stack of convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,Olog nor in the case of dilated convolutions 18, increasing the length of the longest pathskbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive thankrecurrent layers, by a factor of . Separable convolutions 6, however, decrease the complexity2Ok  n  d  n  d  k  nconsiderably, to . Even with , however, the complexity of a separableconvolution is equal to the combination of a selfattention layer and a pointwise feedforward layer,the approach we take in our model.As side benefit, selfattention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributionsfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attentionheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntacticand semantic structure of the sentences.5 TrainingThis section describes the training regime for our models.5.1 Training Data and BatchingWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 EnglishGerman dataset consisting of about 4.5 millionsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using bytepair encoding 3, which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For EnglishFrench, we used the significantly larger WMT2014 EnglishFrench dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 wordpiecevocabulary 38. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each trainingbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000target tokens.5.2 Hardware and ScheduleWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models usingthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. Wetrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,described on thebottom line of table 3, step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps3.5 days.5.3 Optimizer 9  0.9   0.98   10We used the Adam optimizer 20 with , and .

We usedwarmup steps  4000 .5.4 RegularizationWe employ three types of regularization during training:7Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous stateoftheart models on theEnglishtoGerman and EnglishtoFrench newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.BLEU Training Cost FLOPsModel ENDE ENFR ENDE ENFRByteNet 18 23.75 201.0  10DeepAtt  PosUnk 39 39.2 19 202.3  10 1.4  10GNMT  RL 38 24.6 39.92 18 209.6  10 1.5  10ConvS2S 9 25.16 40.46 19 202.0  10 1.2  10MoE 32 26.03 40.56 208.0  10DeepAtt  PosUnk Ensemble 39 40.4 20 211.8  10 1.1  10GNMT  RL Ensemble 38 26.30 41.16 19 217.7  10 1.2  1041.29ConvS2S Ensemble 9 26.36 183.3  10Transformer base model 27.3 38.1 192.3  1028.4 41.8Transformer bigResidual Dropout We apply dropout 33 to the output of each sublayer, before it is added to thesublayer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and thepositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate ofP  0.1.drop   0.1Label Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value 36. Thislshurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.6 Results6.1 Machine TranslationOn the WMT 2014 EnglishtoGerman translation task, the big transformer model Transformer big2.0in Table 2 outperforms the best previously reported models including ensembles by more than28.4BLEU, establishing a new stateoftheart BLEU score of . The configuration of this model is3.5 8listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took days on P100 GPUs. Even our base modelsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any ofthe competitive models. 41.0On the WMT 2014 EnglishtoFrench translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of ,14outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than the training cost of theprevious stateoftheart model. The Transformer big model trained for EnglishtoFrench usedP  0.1 0.3dropout rate , instead of .dropFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, whichwere written at 10minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We4   0.6used beam search with a beam size of and length penalty 38. These hyperparameterswere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during50inference to input length  , but terminate early when possible 38.Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other modelarchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train amodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained5singleprecision floatingpoint capacity of each GPU .6.2 Model VariationsTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base modelin different ways, measuring the change in performance on EnglishtoGerman translation on the5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.8Table 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but nocheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.In Table 3 rows A, we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While singleheadattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.dIn Table 3 rows B, we observe that reducing the attention key size hurts model quality. Thisksuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibilityfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows C and D that, as expected,bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding overfitting. In row E we replace oursinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings 9, and observe nearly identicalresults to the base model.6.3 English Constituency ParsingTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on Englishconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structuralconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequencetosequencemodels have not been able to attain stateoftheart results in smalldata regimes 37.d  1024We trained a 4layer transformer with on the Wall Street Journal WSJ portion of themodelPenn Treebank 25, about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semisupervised setting,using the larger highconfidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences37. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokensfor the semisupervised setting.We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residualsection 5.4, learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parametersremained unchanged from the EnglishtoGerman base translation model. During inference, we9Table 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing Results are on Section 23of WSJ Parser Training WSJ 23 F1Vinyals  Kaiser el al. 2014 37 WSJ only, discriminative 88.3Petrov et al. 2006 29 WSJ only, discriminative 90.4Zhu et al. 2013 40 WSJ only, discriminative 90.4Dyer et al. 2016 8 WSJ only, discriminative 91.7Transformer 4 layers WSJ only, discriminative 91.3Zhu et al. 2013 40 semisupervised 91.3Huang  Harper 2009 14 semisupervised 91.3McClosky et al. 2006 26 semisupervised 92.1Vinyals  Kaiser el al. 2014 37 semisupervised 92.1Transformer 4 layers semisupervised 92.7Luong et al. 2015 23 multitask 93.0Dyer et al. 2016 8 generative 93.3300 21   0.3increased the maximum output length to input length  . We used a beam size of andfor both WSJ only and the semisupervised setting.Our results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of taskspecific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of theRecurrent Neural Network Grammar 8.In contrast to RNN sequencetosequence models 37, the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser 29 even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.7 ConclusionIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely onattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoderdecoder architectures withmultiheaded selfattention.For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures basedon recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 EnglishtoGerman and WMT 2014EnglishtoFrench translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our bestmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.We are excited about the future of attentionbased models and plan to apply them to other tasks. Weplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text andto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputssuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https:github.com.tensorflowtensor2tensorAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitfulcomments, corrections and inspiration.References arXiv preprint1 Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Many of the attention heads attend to a distant dependency ofthe verb making, completing the phrase making...more difficult. Attentions here shown only forthe word making. Different colors represent different heads. Best viewed in color.13InputInput Layer5noit g nat d nc Socr le i de ui t is Onl aw fe ap ov t s sr etl iyes h Eh l pe e ua e p e ph i isi rh mm nuw ws wT n p bL b a b a ost  ,, t .ij ii . , ,s  se t yst te e nt eew r gdl nnl c u s aei t i mih b b irw nl oo S dw haInputInput Layer5ie uub h avT i ii aOtL f j so nte wr a psh ien Epc isp m oi lppanoit g nat d nc Socr le i de ui t is Onlw afe ap ov t s sr etl iyes h Eh l pe e ua e p e ph i isi rh mm nuw s wwT n p bL b a b a ost  ,, t .ij ii . , ,s  se t yst te e net erw gdl nnl c u s aei t i mih b b irw nl oo S dw ha ie uub h avT i ii aOtL f j so nte wr a psh ien Epc isp m oi lppaFigure 4: Two attention heads, also in layer 5 of 6, apparently involved in anaphora resolution.

We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder selfattentionat layer 5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks.15\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
